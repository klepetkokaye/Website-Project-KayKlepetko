      &emsp;&emsp;Homestuck is a webcomic that started back in 2009 on April 13th (commonly known as "Homestuck Day" by the fandom). 
        The comic is known for its interesting writing style and controversial subject matter including violence, gore, 
        and other adult themes as well is it's easily recognizable alien species known as "trolls" which were beings with grey skin and "candy-corn" colored horns.

      &emsp;&emsp;The fandom was even more renown than the comic itself, often being disdained by other fandoms for its intensity and member's lack of decorum.

      &emsp;&emsp;However, while the comic can be brushed over by many for it's vulgarity and it's fandom's chaos, the comic itself indulges in a number of thematically 
        and philosophically dense topics, including but not limited to: fate, identity, agency, growing up, relationships, and meta narrative.

      &emsp;&emsp;The goal of this website is to provide a hub for analysis written by myself and links to that written by others.
