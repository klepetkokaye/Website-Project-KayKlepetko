    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;Homestuck, written by Andrew Hussie, is a multimedia work of both literature and
      art that calls itself a webcomic. It is written unconventionally, using animated gifs and
      still images alongside what is at times pages and pages of text. It uses a humorous tone
      that seems to revel in nonsensical comedy, and many of its characters are so long
      winded that most readers do not finish the extremely long read. However, despite the
      first impressions that the ‘webcomic’ is nothing more than maybe a concentrated form of
      internet ‘meme’ culture with the sense of humor of an 8th grader -- crude language and
      overtly sexual references included -- the comic manages to delve into innumerable
      themes relating from individual to the multiverse and everything in between with
      surprising depth and nuance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;This connects with an article by Aarons Kashtan in which he expresses how in
      “the post-print age ... the graphic novel helps us reimagine the future of the
      book”. And while Kashtan’s paper is focused on how the physical book can
      survive in the digital age, the understanding that the future of the book is changing
      opens up the possibility that a modality as unique as Homestuck’s is still capable of the
      same literary depth in themes and ideas as a traditional novel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;Due to the expanse of themes and the literal size of the comic that I found that I
      needed to narrow my focus not only to a single theme through the text, but to how only
      two characters are used to explore said theme. Of the many themes in Homestuck, I
      decided to focus on the idea of identity. The topic is both one that Hussie explores in
      depth, and one that is very close to my heart, personally.

    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp; Within Homestuck, identity is defined through one of the 12 Aspects -- 
      Aspects which when combined with one of 12 Classes, make up the ‘God Tiers’ 
      assigned to each of the characters who participate in the ‘game’ that the comic 
      revolves around; this gives a physical representation to the arc the character will 
      undergo. Aspects are different parts of the fundamental makeup of the universe, and 
      Classes reveal how the player is most apt to interact with their Aspect. Identity is
      connected to the Aspect of Heart, which is defined as “essence of being, of oneself or of
      others”. In this way Homestuck appears to function under the philosophy
      of essentialism, “the practice of regarding something ... as having innate existence or
      universal validity rather than as being a social, ideological, or intellectual construct”
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp; The two characters I selected for this study are Dave and Dirk Strider. They are
      both players of the aforementioned game and both of their arcs revolve around
      questioning this assumption about the essentialism of identity. This brings me to my
      research question: How does Andrew Hussie use Homestuck to explore the
      essentialism of identity through Dave and Dirk Strider?
