      &emsp;&emsp;Dave and Dirk Strider are a pair of ‘brothers’ in Homestuck. 
      Each lived in separate universes where the other was an older figure and role 
      model during their formative years. Dave was raised by this alternate version of Dirk, 
      known as Beta Bro, who was at best neglectful and at worst actively abusive. 
      On the other hand, Dirk’s version of Dave, Alpha Bro, died off along with most 
      of the human race long before he was ‘born’. Dirk grew up with no physical human 
      contact and only the apartment that Alpha Bro set up for him for his survival.

      &emsp;&emsp;These two drastically different childhoods connect to each character’s central
      conflicts in relation to identity. Due to his demanding childhood, Dave develops a
      persona, officially dubbed a “mask” in the comic, that conflicts with his
      true identity. Dirk, on the other hand, due to his isolated childhood “splintered”, as
      the comic puts it, creating a collection of doubles of himself who each have varying
      levels of independence from him to compensate for his isolation. These dynamics
      between these characters and their identities create unique conflicts with which we are
      able to examine the relationship between essentialism and identity.
