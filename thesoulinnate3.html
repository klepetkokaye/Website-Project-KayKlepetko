    <h2> Dave Strider </h2>
    <div class = "rightHandPicture">
      <img src="Knight_of_Time.webp" alt="KnightofTime" style="width: 150px"><br>
      Dave's God Tier
    </div>
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;The way Andrew Hussie uses Dave’s arc to explore identity is most easily synthesized in correlation to the class
      Dave is given in the comic. Dave is deemed a Knight, a class whose struggle is marked by their need to shed the mask
      they’ve built against failure, and accept the reality that despite what mistakes they make, they are enough on their own. This
      connects with the idea of the essentialism of identity as the mask they build is not their true self, and that self can only be
      realized upon the rejection of said mask.
    </p>
    <h3>The Mask as an Archetype</h3>
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;The basis of Dave’s mask is found in one of the four Jungian Archetypes: the persona. The persona “represents ... the ... masks that we wear ... to shield ... from
      negative images”. This accurately describes the use of Dave’s mask and provides a context through which we can view Dave’s character.
    </p>

    <h3> Construction of the Mask </h3>
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;Andrew Hussies uses direct characterization to create this mask, parallelling the way in which Dave tells others his persona rather than simply performing it. This is
      made clear through the fact that we are literally introduced to Dave by the narrator as a “cool dude”. In addition to this, Dave wears a literal mask, a 
      pair of shades, which both act as a symbol for the fact that is a persona and serve as another form of characterization.
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;Dave’s mask is built out of a form of what he claims is irony. The closest thing to a definition of this when Dave describes a “TIER 1 IRONIC GESTURE which is a
      meager single step removed from sincerity”. This definition employs the idea that  to do something ironically is to remove it by one or more steps from sincerity. This
      removal from sincerity allows the person doing the thing ironically to claim that it is nothing more than a joke and that they shouldn’t be penalized for their actions. This is
      often done as a way to protect oneself from pushback for one's actions and interests. In addition, this removal from sincerity may be a genuine removal, rather than a just a
      claim. This allows them to keep themselves from being attached and hurt if anything  doesn’t go perfectly. In both cases, irony is a form of emotional protection that comes
      when one is genuinely attached to something. This goal of emotional protection leads to the second concept that makes up Dave’s mask, being ‘cool’. ‘Cool’ in this context is in
      reference to a certain type of somewhat apathetic behaviour. A ‘cool’ person does not react with any extreme emotion, positive or negative. This control and ‘cool’ appearance
      is closely linked with ironic interests. Due to a ‘cool’ person not being one who expresses emotion, they must enjoy things ironically, for genuine enjoyment of anything
      will cause one to feel more emotions, and passion is strictly ‘not cool’.
    </p>

    <h3>Subversion of the Mask</h3>
    
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;While Dave does construct his mask out of ‘irony’ and ‘cool’, and often truly tries to achieve that, because it is simply a mask neither of those things are actually in his
      nature, at least not how he perceives them. This is made apparent through somewhat subtle indirect characterization, like the fact that Dave enjoys several things genuinely,
      ironically including making multi-layered ‘ironic’ jokes. Examples of this are when he found an unopened container of apple juice in his closet and said, <span class="davetext">it is like fucking christmas up in here</span>. 
      Alone this is a small irrelevant detail that could be read as ironic, but along with the other nine times he mentions apple juice throughout the comic,
      it becomes apparent that he really genuinely likes apple juice. In addition to this, inreference to his collection of “WEIRD DEAD THINGS PRESERVED IN VARIOUS WAYS” he says, 
    </p>
    <div class = leftHandPicture>
      <img src="davesDeadThings.png" alt="Dave's Dead Things" style="width: 150px"><br>
      Dave's Dead Things
    </div>
    <span class="davetext">
      TG: i always keep birds in here its sort of my thing <br>
      TG: no no </span>[bro’s puppets are]<span class="davetext"> irony this is like <br>
      TG: sincere honest to god psychosis <br>
    </span>
    <p>
      These examples of how Dave tends to be more genuine than he likes to claim supports the idea that his obsession with being cool and ironic are
      simply a facade that he puts up. This especially shows in the moments where Dave does allow himself to show emotion. The first of those
      moments is while Dave is talking to Rose and literally surrounded by a collection of his brothers “SMUPPETS” which are effectively puppets that are sex toys. 
      Dave begins to break down, saying,
    </p>
    <div class = rightHandPicture>
      <img src="smuppets.gif" alt="Smuppets" style="width: 150px"><br>
      Dave in the Smuppets
    </div>
    <span class="davetext">
      TG: if i see one more soft bulbous bottom being like TG: kind of jutting out and impudent or whatever <br>
      TG: im gonna fly off the handle <br>
      TG: im gonna do some sort of acrobatic fucking PIROUETTE off the handle <br>
    </span>
    <p>
      And while this phrasing is somewhat joke like, Dave in the moment is genuine. When Rose begins to mock him for
      his reaction, accusing him of <span class= "rosetext">like</span>[ing]<span class= "rosetext"> the mannequin dick</span>, he stands by his emotional response,
      fundamentally contradicting his ‘cool dude’ persona.
    </p>

    <h3>Realization of the Mask</h3>
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;Before Dave could ever possibly accept who he really is, he needed to realize he
      had a mask in the first place. For Dave, this comes with the realization that his role
      model, Bro, was wrong falsely ‘ironic’ and ‘cool’, and then the realization that he himself
      is wrong about these concepts.</p>
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;The process of the first realization occurs in several small ways, first beginning
      with Dave’s shift in opinion on his brother’s puppets. When we are first introduced to
      Dave, he sees the puppets as “RADICAL”, and in association with this, the second
      person narration states, “Is there anything not awesome about your BRO? No, you think
      not.”. From here Dave starts to slowly question his belief in how awesome puppets
      are. This starts when John challenges Dave’s belief, saying, <span class="johntext">being a white guy who is a
        rapper with a ventriloquist doll is not cool</span> ... <span class="johntext">any definition </span>...<span class="johntext"> ironic or otherwise</span> forcing
      Dave to defend his brother’s interests, saying that, <span class="davetext">puppets are awesome </span>...<span class="davetext"> the
        end</span>. This causes him to start thinking about why he believes this, and doubt really
      sets in with “BRO's weird nude puppets”--the smuppets-- which Dave supposes are,
      “kinda cool. Sort of...”. This shift from certainty that everything about his brother is
      awesome to doubt enables Dave to actually start thinking through what he thinks about
      his own brother, on his own terms. This comes to a head when Dave is later forced to
      deal with his own brother’s corpse. While standing over the body, he says to Terezi,
    </p>
    <span class="davetext">
      TG: </span>...<span class="davetext"> puppets aren't cool they're shitty small fake people who haunt your dreams and grin like permanent assholes <br>
      TG: i was making a joke about being all broken up about it
    </span>
    <p>
      And while he does say that he is sad, he also denies loving his brother and
      the idea that he is grieving. This truly cements a shift in Dave that enables him to
      actually examine who he is, and why he is that way.
    </p>
    <div class = rightHandPicture>
      <img src="daveTalking.gif" alt="Dave talking to Dirk about his childhood" style="width: 200px"><br>
      Dave talking to Dirk<br>
      about his childhood
    </div>
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;This shift, and how it reflects on his ability to discard his mask, culminates in the
      conversation he has with Dirk, a timeline alternate of his brother. When Dirk asks
      what was wrong, Dave explained, <span class="davetext">i didnt fuckin like you that much</span>. Dirk
      offers to listen to him talk about it and after a moment, Dave begins to describe his
      experience under the Strider roof. He talks  of how he spent time thinking about
      everything and processing it, however, 
    </p>
    <span class="davetext">
      DAVE: i dont come away with the impression i used to try convincing myself of, that he was like "mysterious" or "stern" or "aloof"<br>
      DAVE: the only feeling left is this insane impression that i was raised by somebody who fuckin HATED me<br>
    </span>
    <p>
      This shows how his view of his brother had completely
      changed, and with that, his belief that he needs the mask he was taught. He says,
    </p>
    <span class="davetext">
      DAVE: </span>...<span class="davetext"> i dont remember the atmosphere ever not being nerve wracking </span>... <span class="davetext"><br>
      DAVE: it was "training" you know <br>
      DAVE: but </span>...<span class="davetext"> it didnt make me stronger <br>
      DAVE: it did the opposite <br>
      DAVE: it made me never want to fight </span>... <span class="davetext"><br>
      DAVE: it made me hate the idea of being a hero cause he was a hero and he ruined the idea of heroism<br>
    </span>
    <p>
      In this he fully rejects the ideals he was forced to conform to as a child and in this, is
      truly able to reject his mask, giving him to the ability to realize his true self.
    </p>

    <h3>Rejection of the Mask</h3>

    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;Dave’s rejection of his mask culminates as he comes out to his friend John about
      being gay. He brings up the way in which he and John used to joke about things being
      gay, in the more derogatory way, and through this solidifies his rejection of his brother’s
      ideals. He says that,
    </p>
    <span class="davetext">
      DAVE: </span>...<span class="davetext"> this like double-buried implication that the REAL COOL SHIT is founded on this absurd wanky ideal about masculinity which if you think about it 
      </span>...<span class="davetext"> was always some totally impossible shit for us to live up to anyway <br>
      DAVE: i think all thats mixed up with the same phony ideals about heroism <br>
      DAVE: like living up to the storybook idea of what a hero to me feels almost interchangeable with living up to societys snapshot of what a hard manly dude should be <br>
      DAVE: i stopped pretending i could ever live up to either thing a while ago<br>
    </span>
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;This is the moment that the reader is truly able to see how Dave has shifted and been
      able to reject the ideals that were impressed upon him. In addition to this, he recounts
      how this joking about being gay, and his generally aloof, joking demeanor that pervades
      through the comic was really just <span class="davetext">a massive front of outrageous snark to disguise a lot
      of insecurity</span> and that <span class="davetext">as long as i kept clowning hard </span>...<span class="davetext"> i didnt actually have to think
      about </span>...<span class="davetext"> my actual beliefs</span>. This shows how the mask really was both
      unattainable and and coping mechanism for Dave, that how when given time to realize
      the reality of his childhood, he was able to not only understand that it was a facade, but
      throw off the facade entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;Dave’s arc is used to employ the idea of essentialism by asserting the idea that
      our true selves are not shaped by our environments and that any internal conflict we
      feel surrounding who we are is due to our circumstances warping our relationship to our
      identity. This is shown through the fact that Dave was never able to fully become the
      mask, that his identity was unchangeable no matter how much he or Beta Bro tries to
      change it. Hussie having him realize the fact that who he was did not have to be what
      his brother wanted from him is what enables him to truly be happy and accept himself
      and his true identity.
