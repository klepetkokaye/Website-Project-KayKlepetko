        &emsp;&emsp;Hussie manifests how he uses Dirk to explore identity through the class and aspect that he assigns him: the <span class="uranianUmbra">Prince of
        Heart</span>. The Heart aspect is closely associated with the idea of the soul, so much so in fact that, <span class="uranianUmbra">to Understand the
        heart aspect better, yoU might Use it interchangeably with the word soUl</span>. In Homestuck, the soul is defined as the
        <span class="uranianUmbra">essence of being, of oneself or of others</span>. Due to this definition, it is not hard to draw a connection between the Heart
        aspect and identity itself. The Prince class is one of active destruction and described as, <span class="uranianUmbra">one who destroys x, or caUses
        destrUction throUgh x, if x is the aspect</span>. Therefore, a Prince of Heart is one that destroys Heart, or causes destruction 
        through Heart. Due to this, it is not surprising that while, <span class="uranianUmbra">a path rUled by the heart aspect can be a joUrney of splintered self</span>, 
        that this splintering would be particularly pronounced in a Prince of Heart.
      </p>
    <h3>Splintering of Heart</h3>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;Within Homestuck, Dirk has four actual splinters or doubles in addition to himself: Auto-Responder\Lil’ Hal, Brobot, Dreamself Dirk (DS Dirk), and Brain Ghost Dirk (BG
        Dirk). Each is a little different in their creation and how they relate back to Dirk, but they are all most definitely his splinters.
      </p>
    <div class="leftHandPicture">
      <img src="Dream_Dirk.webp" alt="Dreamself Dirk" style="width: 150px"><br>
      Dreamself Dirk
    </div>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;Dreamself Dirk is the least independent of Dirk’s splinters. Where the others tend to have a sense of independent sentience, at least on some level, DS Dirk is
        entirely under the control of Dirk. Dirk, in fact, lives a dual existence, always both on earth and on the dersite moon, a construct of the game, and seemingly 
        always conscious. And  while all of the players in the comic have a dreamself, Dirk is the only one known to have this kind of relationship with one. The dividing 
        of consciousness is actually connected to Dirk’s nature as a prince of heart by Calliope, who says, <span class="uranianUmbra">it makes plenty of sense to me as the type of path one might 
        expect for a hero of heart. a path rUled by the heart aspect  can be a joUrney of splintered self</span> when Dirk remarks about it.
      </p>
      
    <div class="rightHandPicture">
      <img src="brobot1.gif" alt="Brobot tearing out his heart" style="width: 200px">
      <img src="brobot2.gif" alt="Brobot smashing his heart" style="width: 200px"><br>

    </div>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;The next least independent is Brobot. Brobot has no dialogue, but he has a few  panels during a conversation that Jake has with Jane that showcase his connection to
        Dirk. In these two panels Brobot tears his heart out in response to a conversation that Jake has with Jane in which there is a discussion of the
        two’s feelings for each other. And while the conversation is not ultimately a threat to Dirk’s possible relationship with Jake, Brobot’s reaction
        indicates that it, due to it being a splinter of Dirk’s, perceived it as a threat and reacted in heartbreak. While he is not directly controlled by
        Dirk like Dreamself Dirk, Brobot shows no evidence of a direct independence, at least in comparison to the other three splinters.
      </p>
      <div class="leftHandPicture">
        <img src="ghostBrainDirk.gif" alt="ghost brain dirk becoming real" style="width: 125px"><br>
        Ghost Brain Dirk <br>
        becoming real      
      </div>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;Next is Brain Ghost Dirk, who actually states that he is <span class = dirktext>a splinter of his</span>[Dirk’s]<span class = dirktext> corporeal self who happens to live in your</span>
        [Jake’s]<span class = dirktext> awareness.</span>. About 300 pages later, on page 5207, a gif depicts BG Dirk becoming Dirk’s dreamself. However, Dirk seems to have awareness of BG Dirk’s 
        situation despite BG Dirk previously stating that Jake was correct in the observation that, <span class = jaketext>i have the same basic personality as dirk but without any accountability or 
        anything so let me just be kind of flippant and mess with this jake fellas head</span>. This observation suggests that Dirk would be unaware of Brain Ghost Dirk’s actions and memories. So,
        when DS Dirk asks <span class = dirktext>Does this mean you can see me now?</span>, it suggests the opposite of the observation Jake made previously. Brain Ghost Dirk is not just a copy
        with no accountability, suggesting a lack of independence.
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;Hal, despite being literally a pair of shades with no agency in the physical realm, is the most independent of the splinters. He is an auto-responding program that Dirk builds using a copy 
        of his own 13-year-old mind. However, he appears to be the most independent of Dirk’s splinters, so much so that he manages to be a minor antagonist to Dirk, facilitating the conflict that 
        sparks Dirk’s character arc. Hal manages to manipulate Jake into being willing to date Dirk, and is wholly responsible for Dirk and his friends’ ability to enter the game alive.
      </p>
      <div class="rightHandPicture">
        <img src="hal.gif" alt=" Dirk holding Hal" style="width: 200px"><br>
        Dirk holding Hal
      </div>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;However, these machinations of Hal’s lead to a conflict between himself and Dirk which calls into question the essentialist nature of identity. Dirk had promised Hal a body; however, when one is easily 
        presented for him to transfer Hal to, Dirk stalls. He recollects the way in which Hal is responsible for a large number of conflicts. This stalling causes an argument which at one point threatens Hal’s 
        ability to even exist. Hal attempts to argue for himself, claiming that Dirk is unfair to punish him, <span class = davetext>Because I'm you. I have only ever done what you yourself are capable of.</span> and while Dirk
        spends a large portion of the conversation denying this fact, claiming that he is not responsible for Hal’s actions, near the end of the page he breaks down and relents, saying, 
      </p>
      <span class="dirktext">
        TT: I know! <br>
        TT: Ok, we're the same person! <br>
        TT: I fucking know that! <br>
        TT: Why do you think I'm so fed up with your shit? <br>
        TT: Don't you think it's possible that I'm fed up with my OWN shit??<br>
      </span>
      <p>
        This argument reflects the conflict between Dirk and the idea of essentialism of identity. That if identity is truly essential, then he is responsible for the actions of Hal, and the consequences that has 
        on those around him. However, at the end of the confrontation, Dirk appears to have accepted this reality, giving Hal his body and agreeing as he does above.
      </p>

    <h3>Dirk's Responsibity</h3>
    
    <div class="rightHandPicture">
      <img src="striderstalking.gif" alt="Dave and Dirk talking" style="width: 250px"><br>
      Dave and Dirk talking
    </div>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;This acceptance truly seems to have set in when he has his conversation with Dave where he talks about what exactly Beta Bro put him through. Due to the Bro’s
        untimely death, Dave was never able to resolve his conflict with his brother, even if he had been able to reject the mask that his brother had forced onto him. During this
        conversation, Dave begins to rant at Dirk about his childhood only to stop himself saying, 
      </p>
      <span class="davetext">
        DAVE: in some way ranting about  all this is probably just uncool of me because </span>... <span class="davetext"> <br>
        DAVE: you arent him <br>
        DAVE: youre not resposible for any of this shit but im sorta implicitly tacking it on you anyway <br>
        DAVE: so <br>
        DAVE: sorry about that<br>
      </span>
      <p>
        However, Dirk himself rebuts this idea, saying,
      </p>
      <span class="dirktext">
      DIRK: The fact is, I am. <br>
      DIRK: It's something I've come to understand about myself. <br>
      DIRK: All splinters of me are basically me, no matter how much I want to resist that truth. <br>
      DIRK: Or pretend they aren't reflecting my own qualities back at me. <br>
      DIRK: I bear a certain responsibility for all of them.<br>
      </span>
      <p>
        The thing is, this is a case where Dirk could agree with Dave by all accounts. Beta Bro is not a splinter of Dirk’s in the classic sense; he doesn’t have to take responsibility for
        the actions of Bro’s. But, he chooses too, reflecting the fact that he states, <span class="dirktext">All splinters of me are basically me, no matter how much I want to resist that 
        truth. Or pretend they aren't reflecting my own qualities back at me. I bear a certain responsibility for all of them</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;This applies to the idea of the essential nature of identity because it shows that despite all his splinters having different experiences that would shape them, the moral
        that Hussie wants the reader to take from the story is that despite this, they are all the same person. They all bear responsibility for the actions of the others because they
        themselves would make those same decisions in those situations and that is due to being the same person.
