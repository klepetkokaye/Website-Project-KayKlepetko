    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;Through this study of Dave and Dirk Strider, and how Andrew Hussie uses them
      to explore the essential nature of identity, one is able to understand that Hussie portrays
      identity as not just something stable, but something that is innate and unchangeable. He
      uses both Dave and Dirk to explore the idea that we are shaped and formed by the
      world we function in. He rejects this idea by having Dave reject the ideals that he was
      raised in and, through Dirk, he rejects the idea by maintaining that even if his doubles
      experience different things, and even have different memories, they are all the same
      person and no matter what makes Dirk happier, to deny that is to deny the truth.
      Through this one comes to understand that through Homestuck, Hussie communicates
      the idea that who we are is not due to the world around us, by the very nature of our
      souls, even if how we see ourselves is in contrast to that.
